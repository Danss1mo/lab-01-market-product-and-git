## Personal reflection

I chose Data Engineer because I enjoy working with data systems and seeing how data drives business decisions. Currently, I have basic Python and SQL skills, but employers want experience with big data tools like Spark, data pipelines with Airflow, and cloud platforms.

This semester, I'll focus on learning Apache Spark for distributed data processing and Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration. These are the most common requirements in job postings and will give me practical skills for building real data systems. I plan to work on projects using these tools to build my portfolio.
